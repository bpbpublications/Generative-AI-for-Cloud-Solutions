       "      <td>.\\n\\nThe SR latch is a simple combinational logic circuit that can be used to store a bit of information. It has two inputs (S and R) and two outputs (Q and Q'). The S input sets the output Q to 1, and the R input resets the output Q to 0. The Q and Q' outputs are complementary, meaning that one output (Q) is the inverse of the other (Q').\\n\\nThe NOR gate is a simple gate that produces an output of 1 only if all of its inputs are 0.\\n\\nYour task is to implement the SR latch with NOR gates in Verilog. You should use the NOR gate to implement the reset function of the SR latch.\\n\\nHere is the Verilog code for the SR latch with NOR gates:\\n```\\nmodule sr_latch(S, R, Q, Q');\\n  input S, R;\\n  output reg Q, Q';\\n\\n  reg q, q';\\n\\n  always @(S or R or q or q')\\n    begin\\n      if (S)\\n        q &lt;= 1;\\n      else if (R)\\n        q &lt;= 0;\\n      else\\n        q &lt;= q';\\n    end\\n\\n  always @(q or q')\\n    begin\\n      if (q)\\n        Q &lt;= 1;\\n      else\\n        Q &lt;= 0;\\n      if (q')\\n        Q' &lt;= 1;\\n      else\\n        Q' &lt;= 0;\\n    end\\nendmodule\\n```\\nThis code implements the SR latch with NOR gates as follows:\\n\\n1. The input signals S and R are passed through NOR gates to produce the output signals q and q'.\\n2. The output signals q and q' are then passed through another NOR gate to produce the output signals Q and Q'.\\n3. The q and q' signals are used to set and reset the output signals Q and Q'.\\n\\nNote that the Verilog code uses the \"always\" keyword to indicate that the code inside the parentheses is always executed, regardless of the clock signal. This is because the SR latch is a combinational logic circuit, and it does not have a clock signal.\\n\\nAlso note that the \"reg\" keyword is used to declare the q and q' signals as registers, which means that they can be used to store a value even after the clock signal has changed. This is necessary because the SR latch needs to retain its state even after the input signals have changed.</td>\n",
